### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to outline the functional and user experience requirements for a Proof of Concept (PoC) web application designed to demonstrate key features of an AI-driven beverage brand development platform. This PoC aims to showcase how Materialize Labs can deliver an intuitive, chat-based application that empowers users to iteratively develop their beverage brand through natural conversation.

#### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the essential components required to build a functional PoC web application, focusing on interactive market research, consumer persona development, branding and design, product formulation, and nutritional analysis. It details the chat-based user journey, interface design, functional requirements, and technical specifications necessary for development, excluding advanced features like dashboards, authentication, and complex integrations.

#### 1.3 Objectives
- Demonstrate Materialize Labs' capability to build a conversational, user-friendly web application tailored to the needs of beverage brand development.
- Provide an intuitive chat interface that allows users to iterate and refine their ideas through natural dialogue.
- Use AI technologies to generate real-time insights, personas, branding assets, and product formulations in an engaging and interactive manner.
- Enable iterative refinement of all generated content, especially visual assets like logos and brand designs.

#### 1.4 Assumptions
- The application will be developed as a web-based platform using accessible technologies like Next.js, OpenAI GPT-4, and DALL-E 3.
- The PoC will not include user authentication, data persistence, or advanced security measures.
- The focus will be on providing a ChatGPT-like experience with real-time streaming responses.
- The application will support both live API integration and offline test mode for development.

### 2. Project Overview

#### 2.1 Background
The beverage industry is dynamic and competitive, requiring innovative solutions for brand development and market entry. Entrepreneurs need a flexible, conversational tool that allows them to explore and refine their ideas through natural dialogue, similar to working with a team of expert consultants.

#### 2.2 Problem Statement
Traditional tools for beverage brand development often lack the flexibility and interactivity needed for creative exploration. Users need the ability to iterate on their ideas, get immediate feedback, and refine their concepts through natural conversation before committing to decisions.

#### 2.3 Solution Overview
The proposed web application will serve as a PoC to demonstrate a chat-based, AI-driven approach to beverage brand development. By integrating streaming AI technologies, the application will offer real-time, interactive functionalities for market research, consumer persona development, branding and design, and product formulation. The solution will be designed to feel like a natural conversation with expert consultants.
